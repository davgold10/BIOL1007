## A Page on Monkeys 
![A family of monkeys](https://img.caixin.com/2019-04-15/1555302483564385.jpg)  
  
Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey), monkeys are the common name for the infraorder Simiiformes, aka the simians. However, this naming is an incomplete paraphyletic grouping, as *apes* are within the infraorder but are **not** considered monkeys.  
  
### Here are a few species of monkeys:
* Probosis monkey (*Nasalis larvatus*)
* Golden snub-nosed monkey (*Rhinopithecus roxellana*)
* Tufted capuchin (*Cebus apella*)
* Northern plains gray langur (*Semnopithecus entellus*)  
  
### Here are the most populus species of monkeys:  
1. Crab-eating macaque (*Macaca fascicularis*)
2. MÃ¼ller's Bornean gibbon (*Hylobates muelleri*)  
3. Gelada	(*Theropithecus gelada*)

#### And now, more types of text
##### Subscript  
$$Monkey_0 = Z_{a + b}$$  

##### How monkeys are made  
$$Monkey = cApe^z$$  

##### And this is the code to make that superscript and equation  
  
`$$Monkey = cApe^z$$ `
